This is the repository for the paper [Formal derivation of Mesh Neural Networks with their Forward-Only gradient Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06684) that is currently under peer review.

_All the above examples uses 5 hidden neurons_

_Spirals solved with 15 neurons_

As preliminary experiments we have tested our model against some toy datasets:
* [2D Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/galatolofederico/mesh-neural-networks/blob/master/examples/2D%20Mesh%20Neural%20Network.ipynb)
* [Iris Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/galatolofederico/mesh-neural-networks/blob/master/examples/Iris%20Mesh%20Neural%20Network.ipynb)

The code is intentionally left unoptimized in order to be coherent with the mathematical framework presented on the paper.

An optimized version is currently under development.
